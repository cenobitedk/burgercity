## Day 1

### Time spent - 1h

Set up basic app for backend and frontend. Created data for burgers, restaurant and reviews.
Spent 5-10 min on research, e.g. generating a nodejs app, but decided to keep it really simple.

Reflections: stubbing data took longer time than expected. Time well spent?

### Time spent - 2h

Create a logo and start building frontend app. Added some styling and routing.
Spent ~10 min on research since the latest version of router was different from what I knew.

Reflections: I spent too much time on styling and creating logo + error page. Things that don't provide much functionality but looks nice.

### Time spent - 3h

Adding more components (logo, searchbar), tweaking styling for mobile view. Connected frontend to backend; search fetches data from backend, however not shown yet.
Spent 5 min on research - CORS, scaling for mobile view and VITE env's.

Reflections: I didn't get as far as I had hoped for today. I spent more time on research than I thought was needed.

## Day 2

### Time spent - 4h

Add components for burger and burger overview, fetch data from backend. Grab some burger images from online.
Spent ~5 min on research - more routing and express reponse code.

Reflections: Despite creating views for burgers and burger overview, I still don't have reviews and it looks very crude. And I need more data and images.
